# Galaxy Gravitational Potential Distribution Generator

About the code
--------------

This simple code is part of another code I wrote for my own research purposes related to the distribution of gravitational potential of galactic systems. In them I specified the most common parameters of the profile for the bulge (according to SÃ©rsic) and for the disk (standard exponential profile) on a scale of one kiloparsec. The size of the galaxy can be increased in the parameter ```pixel_axis_size``` at the beginning of the code, which is already specified in kiloparsec units. Also, I added the parameter ```upscale_factor```, which divides a square kiloparsec into the specified number of pixels raised to <sup>the power of two</sup>.

This code contains good functions and, I believe, can serve as a good simple basic solution for their use in other projects. The code is distributed under the MIT license, but if you decide to use it in your project, do not forget to write a modest thanks in the code itself, it would be nice.
